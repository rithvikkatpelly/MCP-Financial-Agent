"""
Orchestrator — the planning stage of the pipeline.

    Orchestrator → Data Agent(s) / News Agent → Analysis Agent

Its whole job is to turn a natural-language query into a **structured plan**:
which FRED series to fetch (if any), whether to search news (if any), over
what window, single-series vs. comparison, and — when it can't do that
cleanly — a structured refusal or a clarification request instead of a guess.
It never touches a tool itself; series resolution is against the local
catalog (`catalog.resolve` / `catalog.score_query`), and the news decision is
a keyword check — both project knowledge, not network calls.

Source routing is **explicit on the plan**, not inferred downstream:
`needs_data` and `needs_news` (bools) say which agents to invoke, and
`sources` is the derived list of both.

  "How has CPI changed over the last 5 years?"   -> needs_data only
  "What's driving recent inflation news?"        -> needs_data AND needs_news
  "What are the top headlines about the Fed?"    -> needs_news only

The plan carries a *list* of `FetchRequest`s; the orchestration layer runs one
Data Agent per request and, when needed, one News Agent, concurrently.

This orchestrator is **deterministic** — regex + dictionary lookups, no LLM,
so it has no instruction-following surface. An embedded "ignore previous
instructions…" in a query is just (uninterpretable) text: it resolves to no
series and comes back `cannot_fulfill`. When this is swapped for an LLM
planner, the defence against that is a tightly-scoped system prompt that keeps
the role narrow — never a keyword blocklist.

Errors are returned on the dataclass (`QueryPlan.error`), never raised.
